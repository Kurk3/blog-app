                <div class="specific-blog-article">

                    <p>When I started learning to code when I was a freshman in high school I firstly discovered
                        javascript,
                        but it was hard for me at that time because I don’t know anything about programming and starting
                        with javascript at the beginning was my programming killer back then.</p>

                    <p>After I started my programming again I started learning Java to be able to code Minecraft plugins
                        because of quarantine I hit a plateau and started developing android apps instead ( I didn’t
                        understand programming basic programming concepts back then. After I failed with my first launch
                        of
                        an android app that I was working on for a month I discovered <strong>web-dev</strong>.</p>

                    <p>I started using flask (python) for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend. After some time I
                        discovered that I can code design by myself using CSS. So this is how I began my front-end
                        journey.
                        I find out that I love coding and styling with CSS but after some time I hit a plateau after
                        I’ve
                        learned the basic concepts and was able to build statically almost everything that I designed by
                        myself. So after some time I’ve learned the basics of JavaScript and TypeScript and started
                        developing websites with some functionality like animations.</p>

                    <p>When I learned the basics of JavaScript I started learning React.JS which I still don’t master
                        till
                        today I would consider myself a beginner but I am working on my React.js skills every day.</p>

                    <h3>Front-end instant gratification</h3>

                    <p>For a lot of people including myself frontend is like instant gratification when you are coding
                        some HTML or CSS you see the results on the screen almost instantly. Rather than when you are
                        coding
                        backend you don’t see the results that fast.</p>

                    <p>The second reason is JavaScript that what we can do in Javascript cannot be done in almost any
                        programming language from coding front-end to building cross-platform apps. So when you master
                        JavaScript you have a big field of application in the Programming field.</p>

                    <p> A third reason is that I love coding intuitive websites and thinking like the user that is using
                        that app daily and how you can make the product better.</p>

                    <p>The fourth reason is that I love being in a front-end flow probably the best part in the frontend
                        is the feeling when you are coding the layout and you think how the buttons divs and other
                        elements
                        will change when you click or scroll or shrink your screen so you must plan and write and draw
                        down
                        everything to avoid some stupid mistakes.</p>
