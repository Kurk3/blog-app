                    <p>When I was younger I was always thought that I need to safe as much money as possible but now
                        when I
                        become older and more educated I understood that when I safe money It will lose value after some
                        time so now when I have a left over money I try to invest it in stocks.</p>

                    <p>My stock investing strategy</p>

                    <p> I add my money into s&p 500 index more specifically in the vanguard but I also invest in copy
                        trading on etoro where i find the most profitable trader in the long term and put the money in
                        the
                        stocks that he or she buy.</p>

                    <h3>My Education Investment</h3>

                    <p>I am trying to become a frontend developer in a short period of time so my main goal is to sit in
                        front of computer and stay focused for as long as possible. So I invested money into the things
                        that
                        I am using every single day for example good chair, second monitor , good mouse.
                        - also to learn things faster I invest some money into paid courses so I don't waste time on
                        finding
                        the curriculum for learning some specific topic like for example React.js full course on
                        scrimba</p>

                    <h3>What I learned from day trading</h3>

                    <p>I would like to say that day trading is amazing it looks really cool. When I tried that Iâ€™ve made
                        like 250 $ in 4 days but after that the market that I was trading started losing and I lost the
                        500
                        $ in a one day and I learned that day trading is not a side hustle it is real career like coding
                        and
                        for a majority of people the day trading is just a waste of money. They should rather invest
                        that in
                        something safe and focus on their career to make even more money in my opinion.</p>
